# 🐍 Open-Snake – Modular Snake Robot with DYNAMIXEL 2XC

**Open-Snake** is an open-source snake robot project built using **DYNAMIXEL 2XC-series motors**.  
It demonstrates serpentine locomotion through chained modular segments, inspired by real snakes.

This project is perfect for:
- 🤖 Robotics enthusiasts exploring undulatory movement  
- 📚 Educational demonstrations on modular kinematics  
- 🧪 Experimental development of bio-inspired locomotion
